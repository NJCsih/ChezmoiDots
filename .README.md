# Chezmoi Dots

I run a split configuration system between chezmoi and nix, because I don't love home manager.
- Worth noting that my firefox and a couple other things are still done via homemanger, and neovim is it's own flake. See below

For the rest of my dots go see:
- My nixos config [here](https://github.com/NJCsih/polytope)
- My nixcats neovim config [here](https://github.com/NJCsih/nvim-nixCats)

For a good nix-only config, see (DarkKronicle)[https://github.com/darkkronicle/]'s (Nazarick)[https://github.com/DarkKronicle/nazarick]. They've given me a lot of help in the yearish I've been on nix, and are definitely worth a look. For... reasons... (privacy is a funny thing) I don't really like spending much time on linux configs, but they're to thank for me staying on nix, and having a computer I'm this happy with.
